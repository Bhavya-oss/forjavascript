    <p>Javascript is Synchronous Single threaded language: after completing curren line code exicution then only it
        moves to next line</p>

    <p>When javascript start exicution or run it will create exicution context it contains memmory component and code
        component, memory component also called variable environment and code component also called thread of exicution.
    </p>
    <p>In memory componet store all the variable and functions, allocate the memory to all the variable and functions
        and initially all variable has undefined and function store holl code of function</p>
    <p>When second phase start that is code exicution face then in memmory face variable which has undefined tha will be
        store value.
        <br />
        When go to function invoke then new exicution context will be create.
    </p>
    <h1>To manage exicution context creation and deletion it has <b>call stack</b></h1>
    <p>When ever program run Global exicution context will push in to stack and when function is invoked and new
        exicution is created then that exicution context will push into call stack(E1) when exicution of first function
        is complete then E1 is pop out from call stack, then next function will repeate push and pop finally Global
        exicution context will pop out.</p>
